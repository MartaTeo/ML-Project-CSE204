       " 'I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color The leather is high quality it has that wonderful new smell as well and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two as the front cover folds behind the case and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while readingAt the top of the case there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated The light is powered by the Kindle itself by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown I fear that over time this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly usedMy only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening It would have been nice to include a clasp or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed I paid 54 for this case which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself At that price the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening Aside from this potential problem this Kindle case is perfect and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome deviceKudos Amazon',\n",
       " 'I have had the Kindle Keyboard with its lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this coverIn comparisonThe kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in its cover The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well it is no longer hinged only on one edge but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindleThe lighting is about the same between both cases but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner the new case lights the screen from the top middleI feel like the old light mechanism was more durable The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case and the hinge feels subparThe light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case didAll in all I still like the new case It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle I will be keeping this caseProsCompact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindles batteries so no additional power is neededProvides adequate lighting across the entire screenConsLightbar hinge seems very cheapSince I only received this today I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindles batteryRead more',\n",
       " 'I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger I have never had a Kindle or another cover so my review is based on a firsttimers perspective This is my feedback1 I agree that this cover is expensive Ridiculously expensive But after pricing other covers and other lights then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else Plus the fact that the light is builtin was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient2 Yes the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure That was the main reason for my initial hesitation not the price I thought about using a rubber band around it but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover which by the way is quite pretty in the wine purple color I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed for additional protection and to prevent scratches because3 The cover does scratch quite easily I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover because doesnt that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect My little knitted sleeve is helping with that but I know a lot of people wouldnt want to use an additional cover4 Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle ReallyRead more',\n",

       " 'Ive had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the Samsung line but this is my first Amazon Fire so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these At the time that this was written Alexa had not been added to the tabletFirst while this device runs an Android type of operating system Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system I dont feel like Im using Android This feels different to me It doesnt have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate That being said if you are an Amazon Prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine Its simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etcThere are 3 onscreen buttons on the bottom of the device The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen The button to the left acts as a sort of back button It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I dont need it on screen but its open The button to the right is super important It took me a couple of days to realize what it does That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open It lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out You can close them by pressing the X button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery Make sure you use that little square button to clear your appsThe device has several menus that you swipe left to view First you start with your home screen You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet All of your apps are housed here You swipe up to view all of them The tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as Slik Amazons own internet browser Audible Good Reads the Amazon app store a weather app etc You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter Facebook etc You can combine the apps on this page into folders You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears This made my home screen much more manageable You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings This feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however I believe it only changes the font on your main screensIf you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post Youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tabletYou can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos You can do this through the settings menu on the device If you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazons Photos app which is a cloudbased appSo far I havent found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper Im not crazy about the Amazon Photo app I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazons cloud just so I could view them on my tablet That being said Im not planning to take photos on this device I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaperBeyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen They are prearranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account For example if you have Kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the Books menu Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu There doesnt seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages That bugs me but its not the end of the world Theres also one menu to the left of the home menu Its the recent page It shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet I never use it but it might be handy for some peopleOne of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazons On Deck capability If youre an Amazon Prime member Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like The items dont count against your preinstalled memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full You can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it Ive been content with the video playback capability This isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is OK Ill talk more about the speakers later My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand Ive tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous Now I can always have my magazines with me so if Im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office I always have them One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free I just had to connect my account to the device This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as Ive had an account My other magazine didnt include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version It was an inexpensive magazine anyway There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasureThe Kindle Fire doesnt come with the Google Play store installed You can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty You can Google to find the instructions to do this Its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology It probably took me 10 minutes Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store They have worked fine so far I despise the keyboard that Amazon preinstalled on this device There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but I hate it I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I cant complainApps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy The screen on this device isnt bad If I compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstandingThe speakers are OK There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen I wont say that they are fantastic They arent In my opinion they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the preinstall app but still your music will sound tinny That being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etcThis device wasnt made for taking pictures It has a front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular Im not using themI find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands I think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick Also I do have some hand problems similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives Im still waiting for it Im greatly enjoying this device Its simply fun to use the tablet There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use Amazon services If you dont typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and youre looking for a low price tag this device may be OK for you',\n",

       " 'I recently ordered my 8th Kindle It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen For me newer is just more frustrating However new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground so I got a reconditioned one I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it When it arrived however it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi So I called my internet provider I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country But pressing on I provided my 9 digit phone number my 10 digit account number my 9 digit zip code my address my 8 digit birthday and the name of my favorite pet my first car and my oldest nephew Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having After all this I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make so I pressed 1 for yes Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided Patiently I retyped all I had already typed This time I was cannier I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems Im sorry I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me Well I should have known I had been on the phone for 50 minutesThen my Kindle would not download my archived items So I contacted Amazons Help Line I got an American in the first minute I did not have to press anything I explained my problem The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly I was on the phone for 4 minutes',\n",

       " 'This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015 Essentially the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded 300 dpi screen more memory and storage its a terrific reading device This review aims to describe both this product and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for youBefore I start Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries Dont be put off theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section belowThis review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the endSummary  What can you do with it Read a book It can store 1000s of books  take an entire library away with you on holiday Buy a book You can browse the Amazon kindle store and buy books over a WIFI connection Borrow a book Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60000 books if you have Amazon Prime Membership Share your books Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family Highlight a section Using the touch screen you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines If several people highlight the same section thats also indicated Record a bookmark To come back to it later Read a book on your Kindle continue on your smartphone or tablet computer and it will jump to your last known position Look up a word and record them in the

account or family sharing Access every book youve ever owned on the cloud  available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3GWhat Devices are availableAs of July 2015 Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale1 Kindle 6 around CDN 792 Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation 212 dpi  launched October 2013  around CDN 1292 New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen 300 dpi  launched July 2015  around CDN 1392093 Kindle Voyger  around US 219289 Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada4 Kindle Fire  6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300400So youre faced with a few devices plus additional options Which to buy Heres a quick summary in order of cost The entry level Kindle An entry level black and white eink book reader it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books and a battery which should last around 4 weeksA terrific device to read books and a worthy contender For the technically minded it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an Eink display Essentially this means its a Black and White b Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight c Requires very little power  hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours New Kindle Paperwhite Launched in 2015 this is really an upgrade adding a supersharp display with 300 pixels per inch  the same as the top of the range Voyage The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks  but still a very long timeCompared to the existing 2013 Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screenIf you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading However if you own a prior device youll notice the huge leap in screen quality contrast and performance The Voyage Far more expensive that Paperwhite this is thinner and 26g lighter It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the ereader body which makes it look more like a tablet and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback nice touch It has 4Gb of storage same as the Paperwhite and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single chargeAlthough it has the same sharp 300 dpi screen as the Paperwhite the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright In addition youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness To compensate the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device Kindle Fire Tablet Computer The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range Similar to the Apple iPad mini it has a high resolution screen a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life  hours rather than weeks Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book Youll find it produces less eye strain and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web watching videos and reading eMails the Kindle is a dedicated book reader deviceUnlike a Kindle the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white backlight which is far more suited to reading in bed and it wont for example wake your partner if reading in the darkFinally unlike the rest of the Kindle range the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use its less useful on holiday The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlightWhat other options do I haveHaving decided upon the model Kindle Paperwhite Voyage or Fire the next decision is around Special Offers  ie adverts 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on and are not at all distractingThe 3G option is a more difficult question This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books overtheair instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable but its a personal choice Of course if you wont have WIFI at home then youll need the 3G optionOne point worth mentioning however is if you have a modern smartphone you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle or indeed any other WIFI device can connect to Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and aboutConclusionIf you love books but your on a budget the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you but youll lose out on the soft white backlight and super crisp display of the PapwerwhiteThe Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi supersharp screen Finally theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightnessIf youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2 I was skeptical at first but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand on the train and the backlight and long battery life a huge bonusFrequently Asked QuestionsQ What file format will a Kindle readA Kindle Format 8 AZW3 Kindle AZW TXT PDF unprotected MOBI PRC natively in addition to HTML DOC DOCX JPEG GIF PNG BMP through conversionQ What It doesnt support EPUB formatA No  but you can convert your EPUB books using a

charging the deviceQ How long does it take to chargeA From absolutely flat around 4 hoursQ How many books will the Kindle holdA Literally thousands You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account  so the list is quite literally unlimitedQ Do I need anything elseA Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger but the Fire does Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it Some people also buy a cover but I think this is not really needed It adds to the weight and is not really needed It will protect your Kindle from a drop however and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag',\n",
