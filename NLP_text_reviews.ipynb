       " 'Ive been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past it was usually a nobrainier to upgrade The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it After a lot of thought the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch The Oasis buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already The addition of the cover is interesting but after a months use I think its pretty clear the coverbattery is there only to boost the very shortlived battery in the kindle itself Months of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day The screen is clear and bright I cant see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them Otherwise the existing kindles will meet your needs',\n",

       " 'Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover The front cover is very thin with a mediumweight cardboard feel to it The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen The back cover is hollowed out plastic to formfit your Kindle and snaps in with relative easeUsing the enclosed graphic instruction card I removed the Kindle as shown having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently However I plan on using this cover as a fulltime solution for both protection and as a light sourceI went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked fullout position The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable strainingIf I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover which I have used since its release I would choose this newer coverRead more',\n",

       " 'Ive had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the Samsung line but this is my first Amazon Fire so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these At the time that this was written Alexa had not been added to the tabletFirst while this device runs an Android type of operating system Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system I dont feel like Im using Android This feels different to me It doesnt have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate That being said if you are an Amazon Prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine Its simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etcThere are 3 onscreen buttons on the bottom of the device The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen The button to the left acts as a sort of back button It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I dont need it on screen but its open The button to the right is super important It took me a couple of days to realize what it does That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open It lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out You can close them by pressing the X button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery Make sure you use that little square button to clear your appsThe device has several menus that you swipe left to view First you start with your home screen You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet All of your apps are housed here You swipe up to view all of them The tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as Slik Amazons own internet browser Audible Good Reads the Amazon app store a weather app etc You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter Facebook etc You can combine the apps on this page into folders You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears This made my home screen much more manageable You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings This feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however I believe it only changes the font on your main screensIf you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post Youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tabletYou can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos You can do this through the settings menu on the device If you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazons Photos app which is a cloudbased appSo far I havent found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper Im not crazy about the Amazon Photo app I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazons cloud just so I could view them on my tablet That being said Im not planning to take photos on this device I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaperBeyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen They are prearranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account For example if you have Kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the Books menu Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu There doesnt seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages That bugs me but its not the end of the world Theres also one menu to the left of the home menu Its the recent page It shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet I never use it but it might be handy for some peopleOne of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazons On Deck capability If youre an Amazon Prime member Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like The items dont count against your preinstalled memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full You can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it Ive been content with the video playback capability This isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is OK Ill talk more about the speakers later My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand Ive tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous Now I can always have my magazines with me so if Im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office I always have them One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free I just had to connect my account to the device This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as Ive had an account My other magazine didnt include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version It was an inexpensive magazine anyway There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasureThe Kindle Fire doesnt come with the Google Play store installed You can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty You can Google to find the instructions to do this Its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology It probably took me 10 minutes Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store They have worked fine so far I despise the keyboard that Amazon preinstalled on this device There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but I hate it I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I cant complainApps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy The screen on this device isnt bad If I compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstandingThe speakers are OK There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen I wont say that they are fantastic They arent In my opinion they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the preinstall app but still your music will sound tinny That being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etcThis device wasnt made for taking pictures It has a front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular Im not using themI find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands I think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick Also I do have some hand problems similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives Im still waiting for it Im greatly enjoying this device Its simply fun to use the tablet There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use Amazon services If you dont typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and youre looking for a low price tag this device may be OK for you',\n",
